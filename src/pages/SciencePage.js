          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            MindTones uses a combination of binaural beats and isochronic tones to help your brain achieve specific frequencies.
            When you listen to these sounds, your brain naturally synchronizes with the frequency, a process known as brainwave entrainment.

          <p className="text-gray-600">
            This technology is backed by scientific research and has been shown to be effective in helping people achieve various mental states,
            from deep focus to relaxation and better sleep.
